# Kass-Theme-Song-MSP430

Kass Theme Song on MSP430 Microcontroller using passive buzzers  

## What is This?

Kass Theme Song from The Legend of Zelda BOTW played on a MSP-EXP-430FR6989 microcontroller. The sound output is through a passive buzzer but any would do. 

## Credit Due
I did not create everything from scratch for this project which is why I need to give much credit to Tom Igoe for the [pitch mapping]([https://energia.nu/guide/tutorials/digital/tutorial_tone/](https://energia.nu/guide/tutorials/digital/tutorial_tone/)). Also [vanxanderton](https://musescore.com/user/18723706) for the music composition.

## Boards/Modules/Materials

* MSP-EXP430FR6989
* Passive Buzzer
* General prototyping components (resistors, breadboards, jumperwires)

## Thoughts
This took way longer than expected since the example code from Energia for buzzer music was musically inaccurate. It worked fine for simple songs like happy birthday but once sixteenth notes and quarter-eight notes are added to the mix, it turned into a disaster.

Although this used to be one of my favorite pieces from the game, it is less of that now. All things considered though, it was a beneficial learning experience hardware and software wise and that's what truly matters.
